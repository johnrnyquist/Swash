# Swash: An entity framework for Swift

Swash is an entity systems component framework. The name "Swash" is a portmanteau of "Swift" and "Ash". 

#### History
[Ash](https://github.com/richardlord/Ash) is an ActionScript 3 (AS3) framework that Swash was derived from. It was created by [Richard Lord](https://richardlord.net) to facilitate game development on the (now defunct) [Flash](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) platform.

Given AS3 is more weakly typed than Swift, porting Ash to Swash was a technical challenge. I had at least one false start. Some aspects of the framework had to change (for example how you create a Node). I do not think any are necessarily burdensome. At the very least, I think if you check out the code, you may see some interesting things done with Swift.
