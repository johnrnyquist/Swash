/**
An entity is composed from components. As such, it is essentially a collection object for components. 
Sometimes, the entities in a game will mirror the actual characters and objects in the game, but this 
is not necessary.
Components are simple value objects that contain data relevant to the entity. Entities
with similar functionality will have instances of the same components. So we might have 
a position component
All entities that have a position in the game world, will have an instance of the
position component. Systems operate on entities based on the components they have.
